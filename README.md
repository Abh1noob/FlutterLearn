# Flutter Learning

This Repository will contain all the files I create in my journey to learn flutter.
This will not only keep record of what I did but also it will help me get familiarized with github

### -Every Folder in this repository contains 2 files:
1. Application Folder --> Main folder containing app.
2. Learnings.txt --> What I learnt when creating that app.

### -Creating New folder for new topic:
This will help to see growth of how far i have come.
